# Smart Contract Data for Analysis

See the notes on [academic usage](academia.md) for information on how
to cite the datasets.

- 10 contracts: The folder
  [`samples`](https://github.com/smartbugs/smartbugs/tree/master/samples)
  contains a few selected Solidity source files with the corresponding
  deployment and runtime bytecodes, to test the installation.

- 143 contracts: [SB
  Curated](https://github.com/smartbugs/smartbugs-curated) is a
  curated dataset of vulnerable Solidity smart contracts.

- 3103/2529/2473 contracts as source/deployment/runtime code:
  [Consolidated Ground Truth (CGT)](https://github.com/gsalzer/cgt)
  is a unified and consolidated ground truth with 20,455 manually
  checked assessments (positive and negative) of security-related
  properties.

- 47,398 contracts: [SmartBugs Wild
  Dataset](https://github.com/smartbugs/smartbugs-wild) is a
  repository with smart contracts extracted from the Ethereum
  network.

- 248,328 contracts: [Skelcodes](https://github.com/gsalzer/skelcodes)
  is a repository of deployment and runtime codes, with an indication
  if the source code is available on Etherscan. By the way the
  contracts were selected, they faithfully represent, in most
  respects, the 45 million contracts successfully deployed up to block
  14,000,000.
