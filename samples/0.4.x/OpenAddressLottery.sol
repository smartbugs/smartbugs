/*
 * This is a distributed lottery that chooses random addresses as lucky addresses. If these
 * participate, they get the jackpot: 7 times the price of their bet.
 * Of course one address can only win once. The owner regularly reseeds the secret
 * seed of the contract (based on which the lucky addresses are chosen), so if you did not win,
 * just wait for a reseed and try again!
 *
 * Jackpot chance:   1 in 8
 * Ticket price: Anything larger than (or equal to) 0.1 ETH
 * Jackpot size: 7 times the ticket price
 *
 * HOW TO PARTICIPATE: Just send any amount greater than (or equal to) 0.1 ETH to the contract's address
 * Keep in mind that your address can only win once
 *
 * If the contract doesn't have enough ETH to pay the jackpot, it sends the whole balance.
